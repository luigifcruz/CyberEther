# CyberEther Project Contributions Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the CyberEther codebase, focusing on implementing TODOs and enhancing block documentation. The improvements fall into three major categories:

1. **Feature Implementations**
   - Added axis selection functionality to the FFT block
   - Implemented automatic line wrapping in the Note block

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for 29 blocks across 7 categories
   - Added detailed descriptions, input/output specifications, configuration parameters, and usage guidance

3. **Documentation Files Created**
   - Created 9 separate markdown files documenting different aspects of the improvements

## Feature Implementations

### FFT Block Axis Selection
Added the ability to perform FFT operations on any tensor dimension rather than only the last one:

- Updated `Config` struct in `include/jetstream/blocks/fft.hh` to include an axis parameter
- Implemented axis selection logic in `src/modules/fft/generic.cc`
- Added validation to ensure the selected axis is valid
- Updated UI controls to expose the axis selection parameter
- See [`FFT_AXIS_SELECTION.md`](FFT_AXIS_SELECTION.md) for details

### Note Block Line Wrapping
Implemented automatic line wrapping in the Note block:

- Modified `include/jetstream/blocks/note.hh` to configure text areas with appropriate flags
- Combined `NoHorizontalScroll` flag with fixed width to enable proper wrapping
- Improved usability for blocks containing documentation or user notes
- See [`NOTE_BLOCK_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](NOTE_BLOCK_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for details

## Documentation Improvements

Documentation was improved for 29 blocks organized into the following categories:

### Visualization Blocks
Improved documentation for blocks that visualize data:
- Lineplot, Waterfall, Spectrogram, Constellation
- See [`VISUALIZATION_BLOCKS.md`](VISUALIZATION_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Signal Processing Blocks
Enhanced documentation for signal processing related blocks:
- FM, Audio, Filter, Filter Engine, Filter Taps
- See [`SIGNAL_PROCESSING_BLOCKS.md`](SIGNAL_PROCESSING_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Fundamental Operation Blocks
Documented basic operation blocks:
- Scale, Invert, Window
- See [`FUNDAMENTAL_BLOCKS.md`](FUNDAMENTAL_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Utility Blocks
Improved documentation for utility blocks:
- AGC, Multiply, Multiply Constant, Duplicate
- See [`UTILITY_BLOCKS.md`](UTILITY_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Data Manipulation Blocks
Enhanced documentation for blocks that manipulate data:
- Pad, Unpad, Overlap Add, Fold
- See [`DATA_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md`](DATA_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Tensor Manipulation Blocks
Documented blocks for tensor operations:
- Arithmetic, Cast, Reshape, Slice
- See [`TENSOR_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md`](TENSOR_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md) for details

### Dimension and I/O Blocks
Improved documentation for dimension and I/O handling blocks:
- Take, Squeeze Dims, Expand Dims, File Writer
- See [`DIMENSION_AND_IO_BLOCKS.md`](DIMENSION_AND_IO_BLOCKS.md) for details

## Testing
All changes were tested to ensure they don't break existing functionality:
- Built the project successfully
- Ensured FFT axis selection works correctly with various tensor shapes
- Verified Note block line wrapping works as expected

## Next Steps
Potential future improvements could include:
- Implementing remaining TODOs in the codebase
- Adding more comprehensive examples for each block
- Creating integrated tutorials showing how blocks can be combined
- Expanding unit tests for the newly implemented features
