        ## The Remote View Block
        The Remote block can connect to a remote CyberEther instance running in another machine via the network. The mouse and keyboard inputs will also be sent to the remote instance. Just like any VNC!
        
        ## Usage
        Run in the remote machine:
        `./cyberether --headless --endpoint 0.0.0.0:5002 --codec h264`
        
        ## Note
        This block will use two ports, the first one is shown in the block below (TCP:5002) for telemetry and control and a second one (UDP:5003) for data streaming.
