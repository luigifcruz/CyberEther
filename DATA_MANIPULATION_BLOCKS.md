- Discarding algorithmic artifacts

### 3. Overlap-Add Block

#### Enhancements:
- Added detailed explanation of the overlap-add method
- Documented signal reconstruction process
- Added mathematical description of operations
- Included key applications in block-based processing
- Provided technical details and usage notes

The Overlap-Add block implements a core DSP technique for:
- Efficient FFT-based filtering
- Continuous processing of streaming data
- Convolution with long impulse responses
- Real-time audio processing
- Avoiding edge artifacts in block-wise processing

### 4. Fold Block

#### Enhancements:
- Added detailed explanation of dimension restructuring
- Documented transformation of flat arrays to multi-dimensional structures
- Added mathematical description of folding operation
- Included applications in various processing domains
- Provided technical details and requirements

The Fold block performs dimensional transformation critical for:
- Converting time-series data to 2D matrices
- Restructuring data for batch processing
- Preparing data for multi-dimensional operations
- Signal segmentation for frame-based processing
- Implementing stride-based algorithms

## Benefits of Documentation Improvements

The improved documentation for these data manipulation blocks provides several key benefits:

1. **Better Understanding of Advanced Concepts**: Users now have clear explanations of complex data manipulation techniques
2. **Workflow Guidance**: Documentation now includes typical processing chains and combinations of blocks
3. **Technical Clarity**: Better explanation of the mathematical operations and their effects on data
4. **Application Focus**: Specific examples of when and how to use these blocks in real-world scenarios
5. **Error Prevention**: Guidance on avoiding common mistakes and ensuring proper configuration

## Relationship Between Blocks

These data manipulation blocks are often used together in specific patterns:

1. **Pad → Process → Unpad**: For operations requiring specific data sizes
2. **Pad → FFT → Process → IFFT → Unpad**: For frequency-domain processing
3. **Fold → 2D Process → Unfold**: For applying multi-dimensional algorithms to 1D data
4. **Overlap-Add with Pad/Unpad**: For efficient block-based filtering of continuous signals

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements for data manipulation blocks:

1. Adding more padding modes (constant, reflection, replication)
2. Supporting arbitrary folding patterns beyond simple reshaping
3. Implementing more efficient memory management for large tensors
4. Adding visualization tools for understanding data transformations
5. Providing optimized implementations for specific hardware
