- Downsampling using stride parameters
- Implementing sliding window algorithms

## Benefits of Documentation Improvements

The improved documentation for these tensor manipulation blocks provides several key benefits:

1. **Better Understanding of Tensor Operations**: Users now have clear explanations of how CyberEther handles multi-dimensional data
2. **NumPy-Compatibility Guidance**: Documentation clearly explains similarities with NumPy operations for familiar usage patterns
3. **Type System Clarity**: Better explanation of data type handling, conversions, and compatibility
4. **Application Focus**: Specific examples of when and how to use these blocks in real-world scenarios
5. **Performance Awareness**: Guidance on performance implications of different operations

## Relationship Between Blocks

These tensor manipulation blocks complement each other and are often used in sequences:

1. **Cast → Process → Cast**: For operations requiring specific data types
2. **Reshape → Process → Reshape**: For algorithms requiring specific dimensional structures
3. **Slice → Process → Combine**: For focused processing on regions of interest
4. **Arithmetic + Cast**: For operations involving different data types

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements for tensor manipulation blocks:
