# Pull Request: CyberEther Block Documentation and TODO Implementation

## Overview
This pull request implements several TODOs and enhances documentation across the CyberEther codebase, focusing on block documentation and functionality improvements.

## Changes
1. **Implemented FFT Block Axis Selection**
   - Added capability to perform FFT on any tensor dimension
   - Updated configuration and UI to expose this functionality

2. **Implemented Note Block Line Wrapping**
   - Added automatic line wrapping for improved readability
   - Enhanced text display and formatting

3. **Added Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Improved documentation for 29 blocks across 7 categories
   - Created detailed markdown files organizing the improvements

## Documentation Files
The following documentation files have been created:
- `SUMMARY.md`: Overall summary of the contributions
- `IMPLEMENTED_TODOS.md`: Detailed list of implemented TODOs
- `FFT_AXIS_SELECTION.md`: Documentation of FFT axis selection feature
- `NOTE_BLOCK_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: Documentation of Note block line wrapping
- `VISUALIZATION_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of visualization blocks
- `SIGNAL_PROCESSING_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of signal processing blocks
- `FUNDAMENTAL_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of fundamental operation blocks

- `DATA_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of data manipulation blocks
- `TENSOR_MANIPULATION_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of tensor manipulation blocks
- `DIMENSION_AND_IO_BLOCKS.md`: Documentation of dimension and I/O blocks

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure they don't break existing functionality:
- Successfully built the project
- Verified FFT axis selection works correctly with various tensor shapes
- Confirmed Note block line wrapping functions as expected
