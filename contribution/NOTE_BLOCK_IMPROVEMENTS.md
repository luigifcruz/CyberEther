# Note Block Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the Note block in CyberEther. The Note block is a versatile component that allows users to add documentation within their flowgraphs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Line Wrapping Implementation

#### Modified Files:
- `/include/jetstream/blocks/note.hh`

#### Enhancements:
- Implemented automatic line wrapping for the Note block's text editor
- Leveraged ImGui's `ImGuiInputTextFlags_NoHorizontalScroll` flag combined with a fixed width to enable wrapping
- Updated comments to clarify the implementation approach

### 2. Improved Documentation

#### Modified Files:
- `/include/jetstream/blocks/note.hh`

#### Enhancements:
- Significantly improved the block description with comprehensive documentation
- Clarified supported Markdown features (bold, italic, headers, lists, links, images)
- Added usage instructions
- Provided a clear explanation of the block's purpose and functionality

## User Interface

The Note block now provides:
- A text editor with automatic line wrapping for better readability
- Clear documentation about Markdown support
- Unchanged editing workflow (click "Edit" to modify, "Done" to display)

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several benefits:
1. **Improved usability**: Automatic line wrapping makes the editor more user-friendly
2. **Better readability**: Long lines no longer require horizontal scrolling
3. **Clearer documentation**: Users now understand the block's full capabilities, including Markdown support
4. **Better guidance**: Documentation clarifies how to use features like links and images

## Implementation Details

The implementation relies on ImGui's built-in capabilities:
1. The `ImGuiInputTextFlags_NoHorizontalScroll` flag prevents horizontal scrolling
2. When combined with a fixed-width text area, this creates automatic line wrapping
3. No additional code was needed beyond setting the appropriate flag
