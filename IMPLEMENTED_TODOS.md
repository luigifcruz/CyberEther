# Implemented TODOs in CyberEther

This document provides a detailed listing of all the TODO items that were implemented as part of this contribution.

## FFT Block Axis Selection

**File**: `include/jetstream/blocks/fft.hh`
**TODO**: Implement axis selection for FFT operations

**Implementation Details**:
- Added an `axis` parameter to the `Config` struct with default value of -1 (last axis)
- Updated the serialization macros to include the new parameter
- Added validation to ensure the selected axis is valid for the input tensor
- Modified the FFT computation logic to operate on the specified axis
- Updated UI controls to expose this functionality to users

**Benefits**:
- More flexible FFT processing, allowing operations on any dimension
- Simplified processing of multi-dimensional tensors
- Eliminated the need for tensor reshaping before FFT operations

## Note Block Line Wrapping

**File**: `include/jetstream/blocks/note.hh`
**TODO**: Implement line wrapping for Note block text

**Implementation Details**:
- Configured text input area with `ImGuiInputTextFlags_NoHorizontalScroll` flag
- Set appropriate fixed width for the text area
- Implemented dynamic height calculation based on content
- Ensured proper formatting and display of wrapped text

**Benefits**:
- Improved readability of notes
- Better use of screen space
- Enhanced usability for blocks containing documentation or instructions

## Documentation Improvements

In addition to implementing TODOs, comprehensive documentation was added to 29 blocks. Each block's documentation now includes:

1. **Detailed Description**: Clear explanation of the block's purpose and functionality
2. **Input/Output Specification**: Details about expected input types and produced output types
3. **Configuration Parameters**: Description of all configurable parameters with default values
4. **Mathematical Operations**: When relevant, the mathematical operations performed
5. **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics and performance considerations
6. **Applications**: Common use cases and applications
7. **Usage Guidance**: Best practices for using the block effectively

   - Expand Dims: Enhanced documentation of dimension addition
   - File Writer: Added details about file formats and writing options

## Summary of Improvements

This contribution has significantly enhanced the CyberEther codebase by:

1. Implementing two key TODOs that improve functionality and usability
2. Providing comprehensive documentation for 29 blocks
3. Creating organized documentation files that will help future users and contributors
4. Ensuring that changes don't break existing functionality

The improvements maintain the code style and design principles of the CyberEther project while making it more powerful and accessible to users.
